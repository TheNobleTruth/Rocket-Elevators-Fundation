To try it, log in and change the status of an elevator to "Intervention".

### 3. Slack
Slack API is able to give record of different activities that occur in the backoffice and inform the right people through the right channel. In our case, we use it to inform operators when an elevator status has changed. It tells the previous and new status of a the specific elevator (ID and serial number). 

To try it, log in and change the status of an elevator.
